## Overview

Developed a secure, internal AI assistant to streamline common support tasks and knowledge retrieval for users of the Atlassian platform.

## Problem

Users frequently needed assistance with creating well-formed Jira tickets, formulating complex JQL queries, and finding relevant SOPs within Confluence. Relying solely on human support staff or manual searching was inefficient.

## Solution

Built an AI assistant leveraging a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM):
- **Local LLM:** Ensured data privacy and security by running the model entirely on the internal infrastructure (no cloud dependencies).
- **Data Indexing:** Indexed relevant Jira project data (ticket structures, common fields) and the entire Confluence knowledge base (SOPs, guides).
- **Functionality:**
    - Assists users in drafting Jira tickets based on conversational input.
    - Provides JQL query suggestions and explanations.
    - Performs semantic searches across Confluence to locate relevant SOPs and documentation based on user questions.
- **Integration:** Accessed via a simple internal web portal or potentially integrated into existing chat tools.

## Key Features

- Natural language interface for support queries.
- Context-aware suggestions for Jira and JQL.
- Fast and relevant search across indexed knowledge.
- Fully secure and compliant with internal data policies.

## Impact

- **Reduced Support Load:** Offloaded common, repetitive questions from human support staff.
- **Improved User Self-Sufficiency:** Empowered users to find information and create tickets more effectively.
- **Faster Issue Resolution:** Accelerated ticket creation and information discovery.
