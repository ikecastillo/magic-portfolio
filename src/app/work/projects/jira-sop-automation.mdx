## Overview

Developed a comprehensive automation system within Jira and Confluence to streamline Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) management across multiple departments.

## Problem

Manual SOP review, approval, and compliance tracking processes were time-consuming, error-prone, and lacked centralized visibility, leading to delays and potential compliance risks.

## Solution

Leveraged the Atlassian suite combined with powerful scripting:
- **Jira Workflows:** Designed complex workflows to manage the SOP lifecycle (Draft, Review, Approval, Published, Archived).
- **Confluence Integration:** Used Confluence for document storage, versioning, and collaborative editing.
- **ScriptRunner:** Implemented custom scripts for complex validation, automated notifications, task creation based on SOP status, and integration with other systems.
- **Comala Document Management:** Utilized Comala for state-based workflows directly on Confluence pages, enforcing review and approval sequences before SOPs could be finalized.

## Key Features

- Automated assignment of review/approval tasks.
- Conditional transitions based on approvals or required revisions.
- Automated compliance checks and reminders for periodic reviews.
- Dashboard reporting in Jira for real-time status tracking.

## Results

- **Saved $150K+ in estimated annual workload:** Significantly reduced manual effort involved in tracking, managing, and executing SOP processes.
- **Improved Compliance:** Ensured consistent adherence to review and approval protocols.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Reduced cycle times for SOP updates and approvals.
