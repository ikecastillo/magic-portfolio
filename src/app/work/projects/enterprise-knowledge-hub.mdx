## Overview

Spearheaded the migration and restructuring of over 1,500 disparate documents into a centralized, well-organized Enterprise Knowledge Hub within Confluence.

## Problem

Critical company knowledge was scattered across various legacy systems, shared drives, and outdated Confluence spaces. This resulted in difficulty finding information, inconsistent documentation, and inefficient knowledge sharing.

## Solution

Executed a phased approach to centralize and structure knowledge:
- **Content Audit & Analysis:** Identified, categorized, and prioritized existing documentation for migration.
- **Information Architecture Design:** Developed a new, scalable Confluence space structure with clear hierarchies and intuitive navigation.
- **Global Tagging Schema:** Created and implemented a standardized tagging taxonomy to enable faceted search and content discovery across different topics and teams.
- **Permission Schema:** Designed a robust permission scheme based on user roles and departments to ensure appropriate access control while promoting discoverability.
- **Migration Execution:** Managed the migration process, including content cleanup, formatting standardization, and metadata application.
- **User Training & Adoption:** Provided training materials and support to facilitate user adoption of the new knowledge hub.

## Key Features

- Centralized repository for all key company documents and SOPs.
- Standardized structure and tagging for easy navigation and search.
- Role-based permissions ensuring data security and relevance.
- Improved content governance and lifecycle management.

## Results

- **Director's Award for Operational Excellence:** Recognized for the significant positive impact on company-wide information access and management.
- **Improved Productivity:** Reduced time spent searching for information.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Provided a single source of truth for cross-functional teams.
- **Scalable Foundation:** Created a future-proof platform for ongoing knowledge management.
