        With 6+ years of experience architecting internal platforms, I specialize in transforming legacy systems and ad-hoc processes into structured, automated Atlassian ecosystems.
        <br /><br />
        Currently supporting 8,000+ users at a semiconductor enterprise, my systems have reduced approval cycles, automated documentation governance, and saved over $160K annually through scripting and automation.
